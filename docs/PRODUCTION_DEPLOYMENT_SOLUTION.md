# Production Deployment Solution

## Problem Solved âœ…
Your production server was failing due to `better-sqlite3` compilation issues with GLIBC version incompatibility. The solution is to use the JSON-based deployment version instead of the SQLite version.

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Use the Deployment Version
Instead of deploying the `api/` folder, deploy the `deployment/` folder which contains:
- âœ… **No SQLite dependencies** - Uses JSON files instead
- âœ… **Production-optimized package.json** - Only essential dependencies
- âœ… **Compatible with older GLIBC versions**
- âœ… **All API endpoints working** - Full feature parity

### 2. Deployment Steps

#### On Your Production Server:

1. **Upload the deployment folder:**
   ```bash
   # Upload the entire deployment/ folder to your server
   scp -r deployment/ user@your-server:/path/to/your/app/
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/app/deployment/
   npm install --production
   ```

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   # Using PM2 (recommended)
   pm2 start server.js --name "zeo-api"
   
   # Or using node directly
   node server.js
   ```

### 3. Built React App Deployment

1. **Upload the built React app:**
   ```bash
   # Upload the zeopwebsite/dist/ folder to your web server
   scp -r zeopwebsite/dist/* user@your-server:/var/www/html/
   ```

2. **Configure your web server** (Apache/Nginx) to:
   - Serve static files from the dist folder
   - Proxy API requests to your Node.js server (port 3000)

### 4. Environment Configuration

Set these environment variables on your production server:
```bash
export NODE_ENV=production
export PORT=3000
export JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret
```

### 5. API Endpoints Available

The deployment server provides all these endpoints:
- `GET /api/tours` - All tours
- `GET /api/destinations` - All destinations  
- `GET /api/activities` - All activities
- `GET /api/sliders` - Homepage sliders
- `GET /api/testimonials` - Customer testimonials
- `GET /api/contact` - Contact information
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Admin authentication
- All admin endpoints for content management

### 6. Data Management

- All data is stored in JSON files in the `deployment/data/` folder
- No database setup required
- Easy to backup and restore
- Version control friendly

### 7. File Uploads

- Images and videos are stored in `deployment/uploads/`
- Automatic compression for optimization
- Proper CORS headers for media streaming

## Why This Solution Works

1. **No Native Dependencies**: Eliminates `better-sqlite3` compilation issues
2. **Lightweight**: Smaller memory footprint than SQLite
3. **Fast**: JSON file operations are very fast for small to medium datasets
4. **Reliable**: No database connection issues
5. **Easy Backup**: Just copy the data folder
6. **Version Control**: Data changes can be tracked in Git

## Production URLs

Based on your server configuration:
- **Website**: https://zeo.brandspire.com.np
- **API**: https://zeo.brandspire.com.np/api/
- **Admin**: https://zeo.brandspire.com.np/admin

## Monitoring

Check if your API is running:
```bash
curl https://zeo.brandspire.com.np/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "API is running",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "database": "JSON Files"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the `deployment/` folder to your server
2. Install dependencies with `npm install --production`
3. Start the server with PM2 or systemd
4. Upload the built React app (`zeopwebsite/dist/`) to your web root
5. Configure your web server to proxy API requests
6. Test all endpoints and functionality

Your deployment should now work without any SQLite compilation issues! ðŸŽ‰
