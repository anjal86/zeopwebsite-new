This stretch offers thrilling off-road riding and raw, untouched scenery. You’ll ride under cascading waterfalls, across wooden bridges, and past wild cliffs as you approach Lete, a small settlement nestled beneath Nilgiri and Dhaulagiri. This is true Himalayan wilderness.\n📍Overnight: Lete\n 🍽 Meals: Breakfast, Dinner"
