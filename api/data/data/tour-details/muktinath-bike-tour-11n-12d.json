Our representative will greet you at Tribhuvan International Airport and transfer you to your hotel in the heart of the capital. Depending on your arrival time, you can explore the vibrant Thamel neighborhood or rest and recover from your journey. In the evening, join the team for a welcome dinner and a detailed briefing about your upcoming adventure — the route, safety protocols, and what to expect on the road.\n📍Overnight: Kathmandu\n 🍽 Meals: Welcome Dinner"

After breakfast, join your guide for a short ride around Kathmandu’s cultural gems like Swayambhunath Stupa (Monkey Temple), the sacred Pashupatinath Temple, and Boudhanath Stupa. It’s a chance to ease into riding mode while soaking in Nepal’s rich spiritual heritage. In the afternoon, finalize your paperwork, check your gear, and get fitted to your motorbike. A mechanic will help you do a full technical check. Later, the group will gather for a pre-departure talk with your road captain.\n📍Overnight: Kathmandu\n 🍽 Meals: Breakfast"

After an early breakfast, you’ll ride out of Kathmandu and hit the Prithvi Highway. The route follows the Trishuli River, with rolling hills and terraced fields keeping you company. Take a break midway for lunch before the road winds upward to the beautifully preserved hill town of Bandipur. Once a bustling trade hub between Tibet and India, Bandipur still exudes old-world charm with its cobbled streets, restored homes, and panoramic views of Manaslu and the Annapurna range.

Pass through picturesque villages, terraced farms, and mid-hill settlements. As you approach Kusma, the landscape becomes more dramatic, with deep gorges and hanging bridges. In fact, Kusma is known for having one of the world’s highest suspension bridges, stretching over the Kaligandaki Gorge.

After breakfast, ride through Beni — the gateway to Mustang — and gradually ascend alongside the Kali Gandaki River. The tarmac gives way to gravel as the air grows thinner. This stretch offers thrilling off-road riding and raw, untouched scenery. You’ll ride under cascading waterfalls, across wooden bridges, and past wild cliffs as you approach Lete, a small settlement nestled beneath Nilgiri and Dhaulagiri.

Pass through Marpha, a beautiful Thakali village famous for its apple orchards and whitewashed alleys. Continue through Jomsom, the district headquarters, and begin your ascent to Muktinath at 3,800 meters. The journey is challenging, with narrow tracks, loose gravel, and alpine winds.
