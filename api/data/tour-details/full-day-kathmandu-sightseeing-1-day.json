As you explore the vast stupa, you'll be surrounded by the hum of prayer wheels and the sight of pilgrims making their offerings. The iconic Buddha eyes watching over the square create a serene atmosphere. Next, you'll visit Pashupatinath Temple, an important Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. Located along the Bagmati River, it’s a powerful spiritual site where you can observe daily rituals and the sacred cremation ghats. Finally, your tour will take you to Bhaktapur Durbar Square, a UNESCO World Heritage Site filled with magnificent pagoda-style temples, the ornate 55-Window Palace, and vibrant market streets. Here, you’ll get a glimpse into the rich history and culture of Nepal, with beautiful architecture and bustling local life."
