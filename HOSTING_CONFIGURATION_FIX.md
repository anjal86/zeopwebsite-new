# 🚨 HOSTING CONFIGURATION FIX

## Problem
Your hosting panel is configured to serve the Node.js API from the root directory, which is why visitors see JSON instead of your website.

## Current Hosting Settings (INCORRECT)
- **Application root**: `zeo-website/api` 
- **Startup file**: `server.js`
- **Application URL**: `zeotourism.com`

This makes the entire domain serve the API instead of the website.

## ✅ SOLUTION: Update Hosting Configuration

### Option 1: Change Application Root (RECOMMENDED)
1. **In your hosting panel, update these settings:**
   - **Application root**: `zeo-website/api` (keep this)
   - **Application URL**: `zeotourism.com/api` (ADD /api here)
   - **Startup file**: `server.js` (keep this)

2. **This will make:**
   - `zeotourism.com` → Serve your website (HTML/CSS/JS)
   - `zeotourism.com/api/*` → Serve API (JSON responses)

### Option 2: Disable Node.js App Entirely (ALTERNATIVE)
1. **Stop/Disable the Node.js application in hosting panel**
2. **Upload all files to root directory**
3. **Let Apache handle everything via .htaccess**

## 📁 Current File Structure (CORRECT)
```
zeo-website/
├── index.html          ← Website (should serve at zeotourism.com)
├── assets/             ← CSS, JS, images
├── .htaccess          ← Routing rules
├── api/               ← API folder
│   ├── server.js      ← Node.js server
│   ├── package.json   ← Dependencies
│   └── data/          ← Tour data
└── uploads/           ← Media files
```

## 🧪 Test After Changes
- ✅ `zeotourism.com` → Should show website
- ✅ `zeotourism.com/api/health` → Should return JSON
- ✅ `zeotourism.com/tours` → Should show tours page

## 🔧 If You Can't Change Hosting Settings
If your hosting doesn't allow URL path configuration, use **Option 2**:
1. Stop the Node.js app in hosting panel
2. The .htaccess file will handle all routing
3. API calls will be proxied to localhost:3000

Contact your hosting provider and ask them to:
"Configure the Node.js application to serve only on the /api path, not the root domain"
